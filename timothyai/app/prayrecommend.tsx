              <Text className='font-medium text-white mb-6'>
                  Thank you for giving me the gifts
                  and talents that I have. I want to use
                  them to serve you and help others.
                  Please give me the strength and
                  wisdom to use them to the best of
                  my ability.</Text>

                  I also ask that you help me to use
                  my time and resources wisely. I
                  want to live a life that is pleasing to
                  you, and I want to do my part to
                  spread your word and help others.</Text>

                  and guidance. Amen.</Text>
